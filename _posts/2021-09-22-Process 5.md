Solar Panel Angles for Salt Lake City, Utah
---

The most efficient tilt for photovoltaic panels in Salt Lake City, Utah at a latitude of 40.78°:
Orientation
Your photovoltaic panels need to be angled facing south.
Fixed tilt
If you're mounting the photovoltaic panels at a stationary angle, such as on your roof, the most efficient angle is 34.1°.
2-Season tilt
If you're planning to change the angle of your photovoltaic panels twice per year, the most efficient angle is 16.9° in summer months and 54.9° in winter months.
4-Season tilt
If you're planning to change the angle of your photovoltaic panels each season, the most efficient angle is 13.2° in summer months and 60.3° in winter months, and 37.7° in autumn and spring months.

Solar Panel efficiency
---
Because conditions for solar panels are never perfect, they will never be 100% efficient. In fact, most residential panels have an efficiency of around 20%. Panels with 40% to 50% efficiency are available, but tend to be prohibitively expensive.

Solar panel output
---
Work out how much electricity—measured in kilowatt hours (kWh)—the panels would produce each day by using this formula:

Size of one solar panel (in square metres) x 1,000

That figure x Efficiency of one solar panel (percentage as a decimal)

That figure x Number of sun hours in your area each day

Divide by 1,000
