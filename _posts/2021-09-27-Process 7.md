Basic Principles of Passive House
---

Passive House is a highly energy efficient building standard that also promotes indoor comfort and acoustic insulation. Established by the Passivhaus Institute in Darmstadt, Germany in 1996, “passive house” was one of the pioneering concepts for building low-energy houses and is today a leading building standard.

Thermal insulation for Passive Houses must be extremely effective and so thick walls are built up using ‘super insulation’ to achieve high R-values. High-grade insulation ensures that the home is well insulated all year round which stops heat gained from the sun from leaking out. The downside to this is that this does make walls very thick.
