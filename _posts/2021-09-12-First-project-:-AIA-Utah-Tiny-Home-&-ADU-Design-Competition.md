Definition of home

“For without hearts there is no home.” From Don Juan by Lord Byron. 

Home is often a psychological feeling for people. People tend to like better houses, but when people actually move into a new home, most people will feel a little uncomfortable in the early stage. This feeling means that the home cannot be just a gorgeous, beautifully decorated house, it is also related to the feelings of the residents.Home is the home of feelings. What people feel at home is trust and safety, and they can also feel a sense of peace and belonging. This is a place where people can get relief and comfort after going through setbacks and sufferings. This means that when designing this spiritual sanctuary, it is necessary to emphasize its role in the spiritual aspects of the inhabitants. 

In this project, although the area of the house is not large, I think we should pay more attention to the design of its internal space than to make the appearance of the house look more fashionable. In this small space, there must be an open space to communicate with the outside world and a space independent of the external environment to provide residents with privacy requirements.

Designers cannot replace residents to reflect who they are and their personalities and lifestyles, but we can help residents construct a generally suitable space for them to show their understanding of life

Hypothetical site

This hypothetical site is located in the eastern mountain area of South Lake City. Due to the small number of residents, the infrastructure may be defective, and the surrounding public service facilities are far away, making life inconvenient for residents. The advantage is that the land price is lower, which is more suitable for low- and middle-income people, and the hilly terrain will make the architectural design more diverse

Hypothetical site

This hypothetical site is built along the river in the urban area of south lake city, and is close to schools, medical departments, churches, parks and supermarkets. Residents live easily but the land price is relatively high and there is little available space in this area. At the same time, there are a large number of parks along the river, and the construction of houses here may face the problem of land use rights
